Bank Account Management System Overview
The Bank Account Management System is designed to streamline and automate the processes of managing bank accounts, providing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly interface for both bank employees and customers. Built using C++, this project demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and aims to simplify account management tasks such as account creation, deposit and withdrawal transactions, balance inquiries, and account modifications.

Key Features:
Account Creation: Allows users to create new bank accounts with unique account numbers, customer details, and initial deposits.
Deposit and Withdrawal: Customers can securely perform deposits and withdrawals while ensuring accurate updates to account balances.
Balance Inquiry: Provides quick access to the current balance of a customer's account.
Account Modification: Enables editing of account holder details such as name, address, and contact information.
Account Deletion: Allows for safe removal of accounts that are no longer active.
Data Security: Implements basic security features to ensure customer information and transaction details are handled safely.
File Management: Uses file handling in C++ to store and retrieve account data, ensuring data persistence even after the system is closed.
Technologies and Concepts Used:
C++: Core programming language used to implement the project.
Object-Oriented Programming: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism are employed to ensure code modularity and reusability.
File Handling: Data related to accounts and transactions is stored in files for persistence.
Exception Handling: Ensures that the system is robust by handling errors like invalid inputs and transaction failures.
Project Relevance:
This project showcases how C++ can be applied to develop practical software solutions for real-world scenarios. It also highlights the importance of data security, efficient account management, and ease of use in financial systems. The Bank Account Management System can serve as a foundational tool in understanding how banking software works and how it can be expanded with additional features such as online banking, transaction history tracking, and enhanced security measures.
